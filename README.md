# Darcula Storm

Yet another Visual Studio Code theme based on Phpstorm's Darcula theme. This theme was forked from [Rokoroku's Darcula theme](https://github.com/rokoroku/vscode-theme-darcula) with the goal to be as close as possible to the original Darcula theme from IntelliJ. This theme mainly focuses on php, js, ts and jsx, but PRs for other languages are accepted too.


## Known issues
- **as** keyword in foreach does not have accent style (see [94978](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/94978))
- **__CLASS__** constant has accent style, but it cannot be removed from this one without removing from **false** and **true** constants
- **void** return type has the wrong color
